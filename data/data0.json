Made by Harold Import Company, a family-owned American business with over 50 years of experience, this easy-to-use press owes its incredible durability to its heavyweight, stainless steel construction. To use it, simply place the clove in the hopper and press downward for freshly pressed garlic, or flip it over to get uniform slices of garlic. And to ensure minimal mess, it includes a handy cleaning tool for removing leftover pressed garlic after use."
